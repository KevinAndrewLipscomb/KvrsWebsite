                      Our Life Member, past vice president, and long-time capital grant coordinator, Paramedic Jim Brewer, has received this year's Hampton Roads Volunteer Achievement Award in the Individual Adult category!&nbsp;
                      This award recognizes the region's most outstanding volunteers based on their length of service, initiative and impact on the community.&nbsp; Among many other things, Jim's impact includes winning grants for
                      the squad that have allowed the squad to deploy about $1,000,000 worth of apparatus and gear over time!

                      Our top 500 donors are receiving copies of the <i>Rescue Lines</i> newsletter in the coming week.  Our hope is to keep members of our community apprised of how our system is performing and improving.  If
                      resources allowed, we'd be sending it to every mailbox in our entire service area, but 500 is what we have on hand at the moment.

                      We now have video laryngoscopes for all six of the ambulances in our fleet!&nbsp; This is important because sometimes we must insert a breathing tube into a patient's windpipe.  We must be able to see the tube
                      go through the patient's vocal cords, and that's not always easy to do with our own eyes.  A video laryngoscope literally allows us to see around corners.  The part of the tool that opens the patient's airway
                      has a fiber-optic eye on its tip that transmits an image to an external display.  Previously, this technology was only available to anesthesiologists in operating rooms.  It makes a critical and tricky
                      procedure faster, safer, and easier.&nbsp; The four devices we just added to our inventory are extremely cost effective at about $2800 each.

                      Hurricane Matthew delivered disastrous flooding across the city, and as we worked to help people suffering illnesses and injuries, two of our ambulances sustained flooding that was bad enough that the vehicles
                      were declared total losses.&nbsp; This represents an overnight loss of one-third of our fleet.

                      We've placed our brand new ambulance, "925" in service, thanks to donations from the community and a state Rescue Squad Assistance Fund grant.&nbsp; For the first time in our history, we have <i>six</i>
                      ambulances in our fleet, and they all share the same basic custom-tailored design.&nbsp; This arrangement is critical to operational efficiency.

                      our fleet, and to outfit <b>all</b> our ambulances with safer Stryker Power-LOAD systems.&nbsp; We are still looking for about $101,000 in matching funds to complete these projects!

                Performing manual chest compressions during CPR is difficult, tiring, and impossible in certain situations.  Quality varies from rescuer to rescuer, and deteriorates quickly after
                only one or two minutes.  LUCAS is a safe and efficient <em>CPR machine</em> that standardizes chest compressions in accordance with the latest scientific guidelines.  It never gets tired, doesn't have to
                stop when we&#39;re carrying the patient, and frees us to focus on other life-saving tasks.  It also lets us strap into our seats on the way to the hospital, keeping us safer.
