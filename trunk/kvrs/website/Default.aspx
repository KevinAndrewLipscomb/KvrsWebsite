                Our newest vehicle, another 2010 Chevrolet G4500 Wheeled Coach Type III Standard Duty Ambulance, has been placed in service with the moniker "921". This purchase was made possible by a 50% Virginia Rescue Squad
                Assistance Fund grant.

                KVRS has won a 50% Virginia Rescue Squad Assistance Fund grant to replace two of its aging conventional stretchers. This will give us a mix of late-model conventional and powered stretchers.

                KVRS is shocked and saddened to learn of the death of one of its own members. Evan Collins, recently released as an EMT-B, was a skilled and caring provider, a fun partner and eager teammate, and an asset to
                his community. He was steadily building his EMS resume and seemed to have a promising career and plenty of friendships ahead of him. He has gone well before his time, and we sincerely miss him. KVRS extends its
                heartfelt sympathies to Evan's family and friends. Memorial pages are available

                The city has completed the renovation of the Stumpy Lake station at Pleasant Valley Road and Lynnhaven Parkway. KVRS has again quartered an ambulance and resumed satellite service there as "Rescue 19". Ambulance
                crews will still run out of the Woodstock station on Providence Road (as "Rescue 10") whenever staffing allows, and "Rescue 9" (the Kempsville station on Ruritan Court) will still serve as KVRS's primary
                operations base.

                KVRS has won a 50% Virginia Rescue Squad Assistance Fund grant to replace its oldest ambulance (921) with a new one. We also won a grant from the Virginia Beach Rescue Squad Foundation for another 12-lead cardiac
                monitor/defibrillator.

            <h4>We rely on your donations!</h4>
            <hr />
            <div class='vspace'></div>
            <h3>Physio-Control LifePak 15</h3>
            <h4>We need 2 at about $25,500 each</h4>

            <p class='vspace'>
              This very rugged, very expensive, and very advanced device allows our members to monitor a patient's pulse, breathing, blood pressure, and heart rhythym. This is the device that can shock dangerous heart rhythms
              back to normal. This model includes new features that will save even more lives.
            </p>
            <p class='vspace'>
              There are full-featured and low-end variants of this device. We have three of the full-featured kind: Two from the City of Virginia Beach, and one that we won a grant for. On our 4th and 5th ambulances, we have the
              low-end variants. To best serve the community, we need the full-featured variants on every ambulance.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <div class='vspace'></div>
            <h3>Verathon GlideScope</h3>
            <h4>We need 5 at about $10,000 each</h4>
            <div><img src='image/glidescope.png' alt='' title='' /></div>
            <p class='vspace'>
              Sometimes we must insert a breathing tube into a patient's windpipe. We must be able to see the tube go through the patient's vocal cords, and that's not always easy to do with our own eyes. The GlideScope
              literally allows us to see around corners. The part of the tool that opens the patient's airway has a fiber-optic eye on its tip that transmits an image to an external display. Previously, this technology was only
              available to anesthesiologists in operating rooms. It makes a critical and tricky procedure faster, safer, and easier.
            </p>
            <p class='vspace'>
              The City of Virginia Beach only has six of these devices available in the field for the entire city population. To best serve the community, we need one on every ambulance.

            <h3>Stryker Power-Pro stretcher</h3>
            <h4>We need 1 at about $11,500</h4>

            <p class='vspace'>
              Patients must be lifted, lifting can cause back injuries to EMTs, back injuries can be permanent, and permanent back injuries can end volunteer careers. It doesn't help that patients aren't getting any lighter. The
              electric-hydraulic stretcher shown here can save our backs and allow us to keep serving the community. These stretchers are also safer and more comfortable for the patient.
            </p>
            <p class='vspace'>
              The City of Virginia Beach does not provide stretchers for us. We have two powered stretchers in service thanks to a grant, but to best serve the community, we have a goal to acquire at least one more.
