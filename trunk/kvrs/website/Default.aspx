                Today we put another brand new Chevrolet G4500 Wheeled Coach Type III Standard Duty Ambulance into service.  It assumed the moniker "920" from our 2006 Ford E-450 Horton Type III Standard Duty Ambulance, which
                we'll be selling.  The new ambulance was made possible by a 50% Virginia Rescue Squad Assistance Fund grant.

                Today we made two documents publicly available in the hopes they may be helpful to other squads that are ordering new ambulances. The <em>KVRS Ambulance Detailed Technical Requirements</em> (

                With two of its ambulances already on duty, KVRS's other three ambulances, plus an extra zone car, were quickly staffed in the aftermath of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet#Accidents">the crash of a Navy fighter jet into an apartment complex</a> in <a href="http://www.vbvrs.com/">Rescue 14</a>'s district.  But
                that's just a fragment of the whole picture.  Citywide, Virginia Beach's volunteer-based EMS system ended up with 28 ambulances and 10 zone cars staffed, either at the crash site, or backfilling for other calls.
                No EMS mutual aid units were required from surrounding jurisdictions.

                Our top 500 donors are receiving copies of the <i>Rescue Lines</i> newsletter in the coming week.  Our hope is to keep members of our community apprised of how our system is performing and improving.  If
                resources allowed, we'd be sending it to every mailbox in our entire service area, but 500 is what we have on hand at the moment.

                Performing manual chest compressions during CPR is difficult, tiring, and impossible in certain situations.  Quality varies from rescuer to rescuer, and deteriorates quickly after
                only one or two minutes.  LUCAS is a safe and efficient <em>CPR machine</em> that standardizes chest compressions in accordance with the latest scientific guidelines.  It never gets tired, doesn't have to
                stop when we&#39;re carrying the patient, and frees us to focus on other life-saving tasks.  It also lets us strap into our seats on the way to the hospital, keeping us safer.

                The City of Virginia Beach only has one of these devices available in the field for the entire city population.  To best serve the community, we need one on every ambulance.

                This very rugged, very expensive, and very advanced device allows our members to monitor a patient's pulse, breathing, blood pressure, and heart rhythym.  This is the device that can shock dangerous heart rhythms
                back to normal.  This model includes new features that will save even more lives.

                There are full-featured and low-end variants of this device.  We have four of the full-featured kind:  Three from the City of Virginia Beach, and one that we won a grant for.  On our 5th ambulance, we have the
                low-end variant.  To best serve the community, we need the full-featured variant on every ambulance.

                Sometimes we must insert a breathing tube into a patient's windpipe.  We must be able to see the tube go through the patient's vocal cords, and that's not always easy to do with our own eyes.  The GlideScope
                literally allows us to see around corners.  The part of the tool that opens the patient's airway has a fiber-optic eye on its tip that transmits an image to an external display.  Previously, this technology was
                only available to anesthesiologists in operating rooms.  It makes a critical and tricky procedure faster, safer, and easier.

                The City of Virginia Beach only has six of these devices available in the field for the entire city population.  We won a grant for an additional two that we've placed on our two front-line ambulances, but to
                best serve the community, we also need one on each of our other three ambulances.
