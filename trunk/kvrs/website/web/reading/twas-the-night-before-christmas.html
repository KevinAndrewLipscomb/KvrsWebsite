    <p align="center"><em>Twas the night before Christmas, and all through station <br>
    All was quiet except for our snoring dalmation. <br>
    Our boots had been placed by the bunksides with care <br>
    In hopes that the shift change would finally be here. <br>
    <br>
    The lights were turned down and the TV was off <br>
    The rigs had been washed and the floors had been mopped. <br>
    Firemen and Medics lie nestled in bed <br>
    While visions of homelife danced through their heads. <br>
    <br>
    When out of the darkness, arose ringing and light <br>
    The Klaxon brought tidings of something not right. <br>
    The Firemen and Medics were dressed in an instant <br>
    Aboard their trucks and racing into the distance. <br>
    <br>
    The moon on the breast of the newfallen snow <br>
    Reflected the lights in a hellish, red glow. <br>
    The sirens, they wailed while the Federal screamed <br>
    Moving too slowly, as if in a dream. <br>
    <br>
    The wreckage was there and came slowly in sight <br>
    Lending fear, pain, and loss to our silent night. <br>
    Each of us thought of our own Wife, Daughter or Son <br>
    Each prayed in silence, &quot;Let me save at least one.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    We leaped to the task without further a thought <br>
    And for more than two hours we worked and we fought... <br>
    To free the two drivers who hadn't been thinking <br>
    their driving would suffer after a full night of drinking. <br>
    <br>
    The smoke of the flares, and the stench of the blood <br>
    The screaming of metal as we rolled back the hood. <br>
    The cry of one driver, the whine of the Jaws <br>
    Putting fear aside, we never gave pause. <br>
    <br>
    With one driver out, and the other pronounced dead <br>
    We focused our efforts on keeping our heads. <br>
    C-spine and backboard and IV in place <br>
    We loaded him up and we started the race. <br>
    <br>
    The monitor showed a heart rate to slow <br>
    BP revealed a systolic too low. <br>
    Level of consciousness rapidly dying <br>
    Despite all of this...the Medics kept trying. <br>
    <br>
    Atropine, Dopamine, Epi and more... <br>
    to keep our reason for being from opening death's door. <br>
    We fought and we prayed and tried all that was known <br>
    While trying to believe fault wasn't our own. <br>
    <br>
    The sun, she was rising as we reached the ER <br>
    We'd given all that we know, and all that we are. <br>
    The Doctors pronounced with barely more than a glance. <br>
    And gone in a blink, was the patient's last chance. <br>
    <br>
    The ride back to the station was quiet, and then.... <br>
    Despite what we'd been through, the singing began. <br>
    At first it was one and then all followed suit <br>
    This effort together was merely the fruit... <br>
    <br>
    Of a labor that however needlessly beared <br>
    Was one of a million we knew we had shared. <br>
    As we sang out the words of the song, &quot;Silent Night&quot; <br>
    We acknowledged to ourselves that we put up a good fight. <br>
    <br>
    The punch of the clock, the start of a car <br>
    we all realized and loved who we are. <br>
    And on Christmas morning, as we all drive away... <br>
    We know we'll all try in a couple of days... <br>
    <br>
    To give someone back their one chance to live <br>
    Now matter how hard or how much we must give. <br>
    So please, when you pray on this new Christmas morn <br>
    Add something for us, and for all that we've borne. </em></td>
