<h3><b>2001</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>September 11th:</b>&nbsp; Five hours after the worst terrorist attack
    in U.S. history, Virginia EMS Disaster Task Force Tidewater-12 was on the
    road to support rescue and recovery efforts in Arlington or beyond.&nbsp;
    The KVRS component of Tidewater-12 included an ambulance, Squad 9 (heavy
    crash/rescue truck), Support 9, one shock-trauma tech, and seven
    paramedics.&nbsp; Three of our responding members were sergeant-level
    personnel, two were captains, and two were chiefs.&nbsp; Private ambulance
    service Medical Transport Inc. provided a second ambulance and another
    paramedic, and <a href="http://www.plazarescue.com/">Plaza V.R.S.</a>
    provided an additional EMT.&nbsp; The task force's mission is to provide 72
    hours worth of primary or fill-in EMS services to communities struck by
    disaster.&nbsp; On this activation, Tidewater-12 reported initially to the
    Richmond headquarters of the <a href="http://www.vdh.state.va.us/oems">Virginia
    Office of EMS</a>, then received orders to post at the headquarters of Lifecare
    Medical Transports, Inc. in Fredericksburg.&nbsp; By 9:00 p.m. that
    night, the city of Arlington had determined that it had enough resources
    already on hand to manage the attack at the Pentagon as well as their
    standard call load.&nbsp; The task force coordination team then placed
    Tidewater-12 on 12-hour standby status to expire at 11:59 p.m. September
    16th.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>1998</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Squad 9 undergoes months-long refurbishment, to last another 10 years</b> --
    Kempsville's beloved heavy rescue/crash truck was already fourteen years old, and was in
    need of a stem-to-stern overhaul.&nbsp; When it goes into service in July, it will have a
    new lease on life, and an eager squad truck team to man it.&nbsp; We estimate that
    refurbishment will save the squad over $100,000 over replacement.</li>
  <li><b>KVRS' President also takes office as President of Rescue Council</b> -- Paramedic
    Kevin Lipscomb, the squad's president since November 1995, had already served as the Vice
    President of Rescue Council for two years.&nbsp; The election held in January 1998
    promoted him to President of Rescue Council, making Kevin the &quot;President of
    Presidents&quot; amongst Virginia Beach's eleven distinct volunteer rescue squads.
    &nbsp; At this point, KVRS members have risen to the top volunteer operations and
    volunteer administrations posts in the city.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>1997</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>KVRS is first rescue squad in Virginia Beach to establish a strong presence on the
    World Wide Web</b> -- The squad's arrival on the scene of the Information Superhighway was
    more than just a cyber-accomplishment; it was a &quot;volunteer rescue squad cultural
    accomplishment&quot; as well.&nbsp; The KVRS web site was conceived as a way not only to
    toot our own horn, but also to replace &quot;word of mouth&quot; as the primary means of
    year-to-year information pass-down in the squad.&nbsp; The web site serves simultaneously
    as an introductory brochure, an annual report, a story-telling session, an archive, a
    gathering spot, an indoctrination tool, and a recruitment tool.&nbsp; It's a record of the
    hard and progressive work that makes the Kempsville Volunteer Rescue Squad so unique.
    &nbsp; Plans include the pressing of a CD to store the site for eternity once its contents
    reach &quot;maturity&quot;.</li>
  <li><b>Support Team receives commendations, contributions from police and fire agencies </b>--
    In its first year in service, the Support Team had made some very visible contributions to
    extended police and fire incidents in Virginia Beach (and elsewhere). The Police Benefits
    Association donated funds that essentially paid for all of the food and drink that the
    team had dispensed in that year. The Virginia Beach Police Department presented the team
    with its Meritorious Public Service Award, and the Virginia Beach Fire Department also
    presented a commendation. Future funding for the team (including funding to rechassis
    Support 9) has not yet been identified.</li>
  <li><b>KVRS members win Unit Commendation -- </b>The Virginia Beach Department of EMS and
    the Virginia Beach Rescue Council decorated several KVRS members for their actions in
    February of 1996, when they mitigated a &quot;recreational disaster&quot; brought on by an
    uncommon snowstorm. When <a HREF="http://www.vbgov.com/e-gov/vbcsg/faqinfo/0,1172,6128,00.html#Mount#Mount#Mount#Mount#Mount">Mount Trashmore</a>
    was overrun by reckless sledders, the &quot;Snow Squad&quot;, as it was dubbed, wasted no
    time in establishing an incident command system and a first aid station. The group
    processed 19 injured sledders, some with broken bones, and at least one with internal
    injuries. Afterwards, the City of Virginia Beach initiated efforts to prepare <a HREF="http://www.vbgov.com/e-gov/vbcsg/faqinfo/0,1172,6128,00.html#Mount#Mount#Mount#Mount#Mount">Mount Trashmore
    Park</a> to support safe mountain sledding for future snowstorms.</li>
  <li><b>Squad 9 is busiest crash truck in city -- </b>Statistics published by the Virginia
    Beach Dept of EMS show that Squad 9 (our crash truck) ran 265 calls in 1996, putting it
    far ahead of Virginia Beach's other squad truck teams in this respect. The team achieved
    the high response figure by responding to more than just entrapments during its duty
    shifts. A long-standing KVRS policy allows Squad Truck Team participants to run fewer
    ambulance or zone car duties. To preserve their proficiency, and to make up for the
    reduction in ambulance/zone car manpower, KVRS Squad Truck Team crews also run
    first-response and &quot;ALS drop-off&quot; calls within Station 9's first-due area.</li>
  <li><b>Rescue Council adopts &quot;e-mail repeater&quot; launched by KVRS</b> -- The
    &quot;e-mail repeater&quot;, or mailing list, was born out of a corporate partnership
    between KVRS and <a HREF="http://www.exis.net/">ExisNet</a> (an Internet Service Provider
    for the Hampton Roads area), and allowed Virginia Beach's volunteer rescuers to achieve a
    degree of parity with modern businesses and government agencies that were already
    accustomed to the benefits and convenience of using e-mail in the workplace. Rescue
    Council's adoption of the service brought closure to KVRS' original intention -- that the
    initiative should benefit all of Virginia Beach's eleven rescue squads.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1996</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>KVRS promotes improvements in VBDEMS' Incident Command System and Mass Casualty
    Incident programs</b> -- By combining initiatives from two other agencies, KVRS developed
    a rapid-deployment ICS tool that quickly proved its worth. The first (and oldest)
    contributing initiative was the &quot;Mass Casualty Incident Plan&quot;, a document full
    of task-oriented checklists and flow sheets published by the <a HREF="http://tidewater.vaems.org/">Tidewater Emergency Medical Services
    (TEMS) Council</a>. The second contributing initiative was the procurement by the Virginia
    Beach Department of EMS (VBDEMS) of reflective &quot;sector&quot; vests to be stored in
    its zone cars. KVRS members, noticing that most rescuers were using the vests but
    forsaking the MCI Plan, devised &quot;sector kits&quot; that could be combined to form a
    comprehensive EMS-oriented ICS kit. The EMS ICS kit was first used by KVRS members at the
    Priness Anne High School fire (the most serious fire in the city's history), where it made
    for extremely smooth and effective medical and rehab operations. Also in 1996, KVRS
    Captain Ed Brazle secured advance specifications for the state's upcoming MCI standards,
    and taught VBDEMS' first formal MCI classes. MCI Level 1 certification is now considered
    basic training for all Virginia Beach EMS providers; MCI Level 2 is basic training for all
    Squad Truck Teams; MCI Level 3 is basic for all EMS Chiefs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1995</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>KVRS begins grass-roots effort to bring a Personnel Accountability System to the
    Virginia Beach Department of EMS</b> -- Each July 4th, KVRS handles illnesses and injuries
    generated at <a HREF="http://www.vbgov.com/e-gov/vbcsg/faqinfo/0,1172,6128,00.html#Mount#Mount#Mount#Mount#Mount">Mount
    Trashmore </a>fireworks shows, which draw about 40,000 spectators. As a result of lessons
    learned during these events, Captain Kevin Lipscomb enlisted the help of his mother to
    craft nylon-and-velcro &quot;passport&quot; devices, based on Virginia Beach Fire
    Department SOPs and existing Rescue ID cards, to assist in tracking KVRS unit assignments.
    VBDEMS did not perceive a need for such a system until after a HazMat incident occurred at
    an oceanfront hotel. With the need, the interest, and the VBFD specifications established,
    a full-fledged PAS system was finally achieved for the entire Department of EMS in early
    1997.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1994</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Paramedic John Fusco ends 3-year command of KVRS, gets tapped to command Brigade 2 --
    </b>Bruce Edwards (the Director of the Virginia Beach Dept of EMS) promoted Fusco by
    appointing him to the volunteer position of Chief of the 2nd Brigade. Brigade 2 oversees
    the operations of the Chesapeake Beach, Davis Corner, <b>Kempsville</b>, and Ocean Park
    Volunteer Rescue Squads. Fusco's term as Squad Commander tied that of EMT Betty Eisele (in
    the early 80's) for the distinction of longest continuous service in that office. Fusco
    had been instrumental in guiding KVRS through a &quot;Virtuous Circle of Effects&quot;
    (see <a HREF="reading/reading.html">Recommended Reading</a>).</li>
