    <p><b>VIRGINIA BEACH</b> -- The Council of Virginia Beach Rescue Squads, which represents
    the city's 11 volunteer rescue squads, has voted to recommend the city abolish a rule that
    requires firefighters trained as paramedics to join a rescue squad. </p>
    <p>The issue has headed a list of complaints raised by the city firefighters' union. The
    city is considering making the change, but no decision has been made yet. </p>
    <p>The city requires all firefighters trained in advanced life support to ``affiliate''
    with, or join, a rescue squad. City officials maintain that the city Department of
    Emergency Medical Services can then oversee the firefighters' training and knowledge of
    the Beach EMS system. </p>
    <p>Some firefighters, however, claim the rule forces them to join a rescue squad they
    don't want to join, or one that's not near their home. Many are already employed by or
    volunteer at rescue squads in other cities. They see it as a duplication. </p>
    <p>The Council of Virginia Beach Volunteer Rescue Squads makes recommendations on policy
    that typically are approved by the EMS administration, according to Ed Brazle, a spokesman
    for the Department of EMS. </p>
    <p>However, in this case, the administration is still studying the affiliation rule to
    determine if there is a way to end it without losing oversight of firefighter-paramedic
    training, Brazle said. </p>
    <p>A committee of firefighters and EMS personnel is studying ways to improve emergency
    medical services, including dropping the affiliation rule. The committee is expected to
    issue a report to the city manager's office this month, according to Oral Lambert, the
    city's chief operating officer. </p>
    <p>Kevin Lipscomb, a spokesman for the council, said the affiliation rule is outdated and
    no longer necessary. </p>
    <p>``We're confident that the public will be served well even without the affiliation
    rule,'' he said.
