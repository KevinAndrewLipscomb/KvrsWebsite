    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could see the sadness of a business man as his livelihood
    goes up in flames, or that family returning home, only to find their house and belongings
    damaged or lost for good.</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could know what it is like to search a burning bedroom
    for trapped children, flames rolling above your head, your palms and knees burning as you
    crawl, the floor sagging under your weight as the kitchen below you burns.</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could comprehend a wife's horror at 3 a.m. as I check her
    husband of 40 years for a pulse and find none.&nbsp; I start CPR anyway, hoping to bring
    him back, knowing intuitively it is too late.&nbsp; But wanting his wife and family to
    know everything possible was done to try to save his life.</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you knew the unique smell of burning insulation, the taste of
    soot-filled mucus, the feeling of intense heat through your turnout gear, the sound of
    flames crackling, the eeriness of being able to see absolutely nothing in dense
    smoke-sensations that I've become too familiar with.</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could understand how it feels to go to work in the
    morning after having spent most of the night, hot and soaking wet at a multiple alarm
    fire.&nbsp; I wish you could read my mind as I respond to a building fire:&nbsp; &quot;Is
    this a false alarm or a working fire?&nbsp; How is the building constructed?&nbsp; What
    hazards await me?&nbsp; Is anyone trapped?&quot;&nbsp; Or to an EMS call, &quot;What is
    wrong with the patient?&nbsp; Is it minor or life-threatening?&nbsp; Is the caller really
    in distress or is he waiting for us with a 2x4 or a gun?&quot;</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could be in the emergency room as a doctor pronounces
    dead the beautiful five-year old girl that I have been trying to save during the past 25
    minutes.&nbsp; Who will never go on her first date or say the words, &quot;I love you
    Mommy&quot; again.</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could know the frustration I feel in the cab of the
    engine or my personal vehicle, the driver with his foot pressing down hard on the pedal,
    my arm tugging again and again at the air horn chain, as you fail to yield the
    right-of-way at an intersection or in traffic.&nbsp; When you need us however, your first
    comment upon our arrival will be, &quot;It took you forever to get here!&quot;</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could know my thoughts as I help extricate a girl of
    teenage years from the remains of her automobile.&nbsp; &quot;What if this was my sister,
    my girlfriend or a friend? What were her parents reactions going to be when they opened
    the door to find a police officer with hat in hand?&quot;</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could know how it feels to walk in the back door and
    greet my parents and family, not having the heart to tell them that I nearly did not come
    back from the last call.</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could feel the hurt as people verbally, and sometimes
    physically, abuse us or belittle what I do, or as they express their attitudes of &quot;It
    will never happen to me.&quot;</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could realize the physical, emotional and mental drain of
    missed meals, lost sleep and forgone social activities, in addition to all the tragedy my
    eyes have seen.</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could know the brotherhood and self-satisfaction of
    helping to save a life or preserving someone's property, or being able to be there in time
    of crisis, or creating order from total chaos.</em></p>
    <p align="center"><em>I wish you could understand what it feels like to have a little boy
    tugging at your arm and asking, &quot;Is Mommy okay?&quot;&nbsp; Not even being able to
    look in his eyes without tears from your own and not knowing what to say.&nbsp; Or to have
    to hold back a long time friend who watches his buddy having rescue breathing done on him
    as they take him away in the ambulance.&nbsp; You know all along he did not have his seat
    belt on.&nbsp; A sensation that I have become too familiar with.&nbsp; Unless you have
    lived this kind of life, you will never truly understand or appreciate who I am, what we
    are, or what our job really means to us...&nbsp; I wish you could though.</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Appreciate and support your local firefighters and EMS workers.&nbsp; One day they may
    be saving your property or your life.</td>
