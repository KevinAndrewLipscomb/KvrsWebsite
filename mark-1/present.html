<h3><a NAME="WhatIs"></a>What is the Kempsville Rescue Squad?</h3>

<p>The Kempsville Volunteer Rescue Squad (KVRS) is a public charity (501(C)(3)) that
maintains: 

<ul>
  <li>A large all-volunteer force of Emergency Medical Technicians (basic and advanced levels)
    and Paramedics;</li>
  <li>A fleet of emergency response vehicles that includes mobile intensive care ambulances,
    quick-response intercept vehicles, a heavy-duty crash/rescue truck, and a multipurpose
    support truck.</li>
</ul>

<p>KVRS responds to 9-1-1 and other calls involving illnesses and injuries of all natures
and magnitudes. We provide skilled, compassionate medical care, safe and rapid ambulance
transportation, and quick and effective rescue services. We also provide support services
at the scenes of extended and/or laborious police, fire, and rescue incidents. We are on
call 24 hours per day, every day.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Fit"></a>How does the squad fit into Virginia Beach's emergency services?</h3>

<p>KVRS is a unit of the <a HREF="http://www.vabeachems.com">Virginia Beach
Department of Emergency&nbsp;Medical Services</a>  <i>(<a href="http://www.vbgov.com/dept/ems/access/">member
access</a>)</i>. We are one of eleven all-volunteer
rescue squads that cooperate to serve the <a HREF="http://www.city.virginia-beach.va.us/">City
of Virginia Beach</a>. Virginia Beach is the largest city in the U.S.A. with an
all-volunteer rescue squad system.</p>

<p>KVRS is dispatched by the Virginia Beach Emergency Operations (9-1-1) Center. We work
closely with the Virginia Beach Fire Department to make sure that our clients receive
quick, definitive care, even when our units are distant or busy on other calls.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Benefit"></a>How else does the squad benefit the community?</h3>

<p>KVRS leads the city's rescue squad system in the advancement of mass casualty incident
management techniques, disaster preparedness, and rescuer accountability and safety
systems. Many of our members teach emergency medical and rescue classes at the local
community college and at the city's EMS training center. Some of our members offer CPR
classes to community groups and businesses. We provide demonstrations, standbys, and
non-emergency transports on a pre-arranged basis, and our squad serves as an excellent
platform for leadership development.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Income"></a>What are the squad's sources of income?</h3>

<p>KVRS receives the vast majority of its income in the form of donations from the
citizens and businesses that it serves. Less significant income includes a small legacy
stipend from the City of Virginia Beach, and occasional grants. KVRS has never charged its
clients for services rendered.</p>

<h3><a NAME="HowSpent"></a>How are donations spent?</h3>

<p>Donations are spent, in descending order, on capital outlays (new vehicles and field
equipment), vehicle maintenance and repair, consumable medical supplies and oxygen, fund
drive and recruitment campaigns, repair and maintenance of field equipment, uniforms, and
training. (Most training is provided by the City of Virginia Beach.) KVRS does not pay
wages or salaries to any of its members.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Governance"></a>Who governs the squad?</h3>

<p>Administratively, the squad is self-governed. Its Board of Directors and corporate
officers are all active members of KVRS.</p>

<p>Operationally, the squad is governed by a Captain chosen from amongst its active
members. The Captain answers to a chain of command that culminates with the Director of
the <a HREF="http://www.vabeachems.com">Virginia
Beach Department of Emergency Medical Services</a>.</p>
