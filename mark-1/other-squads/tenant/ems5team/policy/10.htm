DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES<br>
ALTERNATE DUTY SUPERVISOR POLICY</font></p>

<dl>
  <dt><font face="Times New Roman">PURPOSE:</font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Times New Roman">The purpose of this policy is to provide designation and
    operational guidelines for an alternate to the on duty field supervisor.</font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Times New Roman">APPLICABILITY:</font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Times New Roman">This policy shall apply to all certified members of the
    Department of Emergency Medical Services.</font></dd>
  <dt><font face="Times New Roman">POLICY STATEMENT:</font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Times New Roman">The availability of a city-wide field supervisor is
    essential to effective EMS operations. While the EMS-5 duty supervisor program is
    effective, there needs to be provisions for alternate control when EMS-5 is committed on
    extended incidents. This supporting position will be designated EMS-10.</font></dd>
</dl>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the event of an extended incident such as a large fire,
fatality entrapment, search, etc., EMS-5 cannot be expected to properly act in a command
role and still supervise other ongoing operations. The EMS-10 position is intended to
provide a temporary support role until EMS-5 becomes available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Any active member of the EMS-5 team or those of a rank of
Squad Commander or above are qualified to assume this position.&nbsp; Anyone of the rank
of Squad Commander wishing to man EMS-10 must have completed two EMS-5 duties under
supervision.&nbsp; After each of these duties, an EMS-5 Candidate Field <a
href="../Default.htm">Evaluation Form</a> must be completed and forwarded to the EMS
Administration Office with copies to the Special Operations Brigade Chief and Special
Operations Captain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to establish EMS-10, a member must be positioned
in a DEMS vehicle. <u>No unit will be unmanned to support this</u>. The member will
contact communications over the air and advise the following:</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Dispatcher, show EMS-10 manned with (unit/name)
    on-board. I will be assuming the role of EMS supervisor until EMS-5 becomes
    available.&quot;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">EMS-10 should advise EMS-5 that he is maimed when ft can be
    done so without interrupting ongoing operations.&nbsp; The Duty Administrator should
    always be notified<em> [deprecated]</em>.&nbsp; EMS-10 should obtain a status of manned
    units as soon as possible via the most practical means. Phone contact is the recommended
    approach.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">The alternate supervisor will not supersede any Brigade
    Commander or Administrator handling field operations. He/she should consult with them to
    determine if EMS-10 needs to be manned.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Members responding to man the EMS-10 position will not sign
    on until they are in an EMS vehicle with access to both a main and a portable radio. They
    should also base their response on the ongoing call demand. If a need for ambulances or
    zone cars exists, then those units must be manned first. For example, EMS-10 should not
    occupy the Zone 2 car when additional ALS is requested for a major Bay Bridge Tunnel call.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">EMS-10 is not a standing position. Members will not operate
    vehicles or use the designation unless in an active supervisory status. He/she will unman
    once EMS-5 is ready to resume normal operations. EMS-10 will never be manned when EMS-5 is
    unmanned.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This policy shall become effective upon the approval of
the Director of Emergency Medical Services.</font></p>
