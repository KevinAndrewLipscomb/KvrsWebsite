<p>The Kempsville Rescue Squad is an all-volunteer organization with primary
responsibility for the emergency medical and rescue needs of over 100,000 citizens of the
Kempsville area. It is one of eleven separate all-volunteer squads that cooperate to serve
the city of Virginia Beach. Its membership includes over 120 EMTs, Shock/Trauma Techs,
Cardiac Techs, and Paramedics. The squad operates four Advanced Life Support ambulances,
two quick-response sedans, one quick response utility truck, and one heavy-duty
crash/rescue truck. Operations are conducted from the squad's Headquarters on Ruritan
Court off of Witchduck Road, and from a satellite station at Lynnhaven Parkway and
Pleasant Valley Road.</p>

<p>The Squad receives virtually all its income in the form of donations from the citizens
and businesses it serves. Its services have always been free.</p>
