  <li>Nip problems in the bud...Respond to messages quickly</li>
  <li>Divide and Conquer...Tune your <i><b>sphere of concern</b></i> to your <i><b>span of

    -- restructure if you have too many or too few.</li>

<h3><a name="InvertedPyramid"></a>The Inverted Pyramid of Priorities</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Virginia Beach's population boom of the 1970's and 1980's put a stress on
  Virginia Beach's volunteer rescue squad system that it had never experienced before. The
  system's response to the increase in demand was not ideal, and it could've led to
  collapse.&nbsp; This is a description of the strategy that may have saved us
  from demise.</p>
  <p align="left">Many things were changing at once in the 1970's and 1980's: &nbsp;
  Technology, the economy, the 9-1-1 system, the healthcare system, the dwindling number of
  housewives, the sky-rocketing number of cars on the roads, and the population of Virginia
  Beach were just a few.&nbsp; It was very hard to gauge how these trends would affect the
  future, but two things were certain:&nbsp; The demand for EMS services was growing, and
  the number of volunteers seemed to be shrinking.&nbsp; To the volunteer rescue squad
  members of those days, this is what the public seemed to want, in order of how often they
  were needed:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/diagram-demand.gif" alt="demand.gif (5898 bytes)" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="275"></p>
  <p align="left">When it came to deciding what kind of unit a member should staff, the
  system, for the most part, assigned its priorities according to the public's
  minute-to-minute demands, as shown above.&nbsp; This priority scheme led to the following
  situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p align="left">No matter how capable and experienced a member was, if he or she were
      available during a time when the system was short-staffed on ambulances, that member came
      under intense pressure to spend their entire shift manning another ambulance.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Even if the member had been looking forward to staffing a more
      specialized (and therefore less busy) unit, he or she might be told to staff a
      less-specialized, much busier unit instead for an entire shift (or face disciplinary action).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The most capable and experienced members became the ones most likely to
      experience uncertainty, disappointment, and trouble when they showed up for their
      scheduled duties.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Because members were being called back to staff the less-specialized
      units, the system was often without any duty extrication units or a duty chief.&nbsp; In
      the absence of a duty chief, the dispatcher was the only universally-recognized central
      coordinator.&nbsp; Since most dispatchers lacked a comprehensive understanding of how a
      volunteer rescue squad system operated, the system was frequently plunged into near chaos.
      &nbsp; Even worse, there were always rescue squad members who would challenge the poor
      dispatcher's authority.&nbsp; Some ambulance units would try to assert authority over
      other ambulance units, because, after all, they were staffed with members who felt they should have been staffing ALS cars, or crash trucks, or the duty chief's car.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Exposure to uncertainty, disappointment, chaos, a weak authority
      structure, and an atmosphere of in-fighting, drove many very capable, very experienced
      members away.&nbsp; Such members found themselves to be much more appreciated in other
      agencies -- all of which were now growing, paid, career agencies that were looking for
      talent and empowering recruits to implement new programs and projects.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">As the best members were lost to other agencies, the system found itself
      not only with fewer and fewer true leaders, but also with fewer meat-and-potatoes units --
      ambulances and zone cars.&nbsp; Many of the members who were aware of the importance (and
      techniques) of recruiting were leaving.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">A prime example of these factors is KVRS's experience with the FOSB (Fraternal Order of <i>[Secret]</i> Brothers)
  during the late 80's.&nbsp; The FOSB was a group of members who became an award-winning technical rescue team, using our Squad-9
  as their platform.&nbsp; When KVRS refused to give them credit for their squad truck duties, instead telling them to run a full
  set of ambulance duties, they quit -- and for all intents and purposes became the Virginia Beach Fire Department's Company 10,
  using Tech-1 as their platform.&nbsp; KVRS lost these members as ambulance providers altogether, and lost control of extrication
  responses forever, city-wide.&nbsp; FOSB members would likely not have minded, however, running an ambulance call once or twice
  during their squad truck shift when demand for transports peaked.&nbsp; In fact, they may have relished the chance to display
  their wide range of capabilities, as most Squad-9 crews do today.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, in the early to mid 1990's, Virginia Beach EMS Director, Bruce
  Edwards, offered clear support for a <em><strong>complete reversal</strong></em> of
  staffing priorities.&nbsp; He called it, <strong>The Inverted Pyramid</strong>:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/diagram-utility.gif" alt="utility.gif (5321 bytes)" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="275"></p>
  <p align="left">The new priority scheme was one part strategy for every one part faith.
  &nbsp; As it turns out, the faith component was well-placed.&nbsp; Here are some
  corollaries and consequences of the Inverted Pyramid of Priorities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p align="left">Corollary:&nbsp; If you schedule your most specialized resources (ie,
      chiefs and extricators) before you start scheduling your least specialized resources (ie,
      ALS and BLS providers), you will only fall short on the least-specialized end.&nbsp; When
      heavy demand requires that off-duty volunteers be called in, almost everyone can fill the
      gaps at the less-specialized end. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Corollary:&nbsp; When call demand and time constraints make it
      necessary, more specialized members (extricators, for instance) can temporarily be given
      less specialized assignments.&nbsp; Upon completing such temporary assignments, such
      members can return to their more specialized duties.&nbsp; These members end up exercising
      their many capabilities while retaining their more specialized primary roles, which adds
      to their esteem.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The Duty Chief is ever-present.&nbsp; A question commonly heard on the
      radio years ago -- &quot;Is EMS-5 manned?&quot; -- is quite uncommon today.&nbsp; The Duty
      Chief&nbsp; is recognized by city staffers, rank-and-file members, dispatchers, and other
      agencies as the properly authorized, widely empowered central coordinator for the system.
      &nbsp; On-shift power-plays are nipped in the bud.&nbsp; Good order and discipline is the
      norm.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">KVRS strongly recommends the Inverted Pyramid of Priorities to other
  volunteer emergency organizations.</p>

  <p>Read an excellent collection of &quot;successful strategies&quot; for process
  improvement in the following paper:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;<em>It is vital to the success of improvement efforts to realize that process

      effect lasting improvement.</em>&quot;</p>

  <p>Although this paper was originally written for software developers, it contains some
  key concepts that are directly applicable to process improvement in a volunteer emergency
  organization.</p>

<h3><a name="RegardingWebSiteDesign"></a>Regarding web site design...</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To take full advantage of the what the World Wide Web has to offer, remember that it is
    a medium <b>not only</b> of words, graphics, sounds, Java applets, and the like, but of <b>links</b>
    between any and all of the products of digitization -- and human knowledge.</li>
  <li>Because first impressions count, we have placed only 18 kilobytes of data (text and
    graphics) on our front page. Consequently, it loads very quickly compared to many other
    sites' front pages. This should create the perception of a very rapid server response,
    thereby making it more likely that people will dive deeper into the site. For the same
    reason, we have only placed high-bandwidth items (photographs, sounds, large documents)
    behind links that informed people would expect to take longer to download. </li>
