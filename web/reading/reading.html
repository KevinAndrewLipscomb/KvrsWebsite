    <p>A virtual owner's and operator's manual for volunteer rescue squads. This book (101
    pages) contains ten chapters, each written by prominent Virginia EMS volunteers. It's
    especially valuable to organizations experiencing high turnover. Each chapter is
    jam-packed with no-nonsense information that will guide those who haven't run a rescue
    squad before, or act as an excellent reference for those who have. Each chapter concludes
    with a straightforward checklist with which to evaluate your squad's condition. Each
    chapter stands by itself, so you can &quot;assign&quot; different chapters to different
    officers or committees for action, or your board can visit (and revisit) chapters on, say,
    a month-to-month basis as a means to achieve continuous improvement. Chapters include
    Organization and Administration; Corporate Structure and State Licensure; Risk Management;
    Financial Management; Fundraising; Organizing the Membership; Effective Leadership;
    Planning and Evaluation; Public Relations; Participation in the EMS System and Sources of
    Help. Originally published by The Institute for Leadership and Volunteer Development at
    Virginia Tech.</p>

  <p><b><i>The Future of Volunteer Fire and Rescue Services: Taming the Dragons of Change</i></b>,
  by Perkins &amp; Benoit, published by Fire Protection Publications, Oklahoma State
  University, Stillwater, Oklahoma, 1996.<ul>
    <p>Written by &quot;sociologists with practical experience in the volunteer fire and
    rescue service&quot;; written for those who &quot;have real-world responsibilities for
    volunteer fire and EMS services&quot;. The section on &quot;Vicious and Virtuous Volunteer
    Emergency Organizations&quot; is especially enlightening.</p>
