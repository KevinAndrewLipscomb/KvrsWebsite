<p><font FACE="Korinna">In keeping with <a href="standby_config.htm">Policy Statement
98-07-01-02, <em>Standby Configuration of Hydraulic Tools on the Crash Truck</em></a>, the
following operational guideline is suggested as the initial strategy for attacking a
standard, easily accessible automotive entrapment with the hydraulic rescue tools:</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Korinna">Until a second squad truck arrives,</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font FACE="Korinna">Electric pump #1 and reel #1 (Circuit #1) should be dedicated to
    the Jaws, and the Jaws should be carried to the equipment staging area.</font></li>
  <li><font FACE="Korinna">Electric pump #2 and reel #2 (Circuit #2) should be dedicated to
    the O-cutter, and the O-cutter should be carried to the equipment staging area.</font></li>
  <li><font FACE="Korinna">Electric pump #3 and reel #3 (Circuit #3) should be dedicated to
    the Combination Tool, and the Combination Tool should be carried to the equipment staging
    area at the AIC's discretion.</font></li>
  <li><font FACE="Korinna">If the rams are required, a fourth circuit should be rigged at the
    equipment staging area to power them. Circuit #4 should be powered by the portable
    gasoline pump and should incorporate a dumpable manifold.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font FACE="Korinna">This strategy offers the following advantages:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font FACE="Korinna">From the moment the electric pumps are started and pressurized, the
    first arriving rescuers have three (presumably reliable) pre-rigged circuits at their
    disposal. Their progress with these tools never has to be interrupted while additional
    rescuers rig additional tools.</font></li>
  <li><font FACE="Korinna">Experience has shown that rigging additional circuits is a
    less-reliable process than using pre-rigged circuits. This is because pre-rigged circuits
    are not as prone to damage, dirt contamination, and incorrect assembly. Using the above
    strategy, the more reliable pre-rigged circuits never get disconnected for the sake of
    rigging new, less reliable circuits.</font></li>
</ul>
