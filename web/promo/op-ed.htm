    <h2>The volunteer spirit drives Virginia Beach rescue squad</h2>

    <p>Virginia Beach is believed to be the largest city in the nation to rely on an
    all-volunteer rescue squad for emergency services. That says something about the Beach. </p>
    <p>The fact that 750 of the city's residents are so intensely civic-minded that they would
    volunteer for such duty is a terrific credit to the Beach. </p>
    <p>And yet, for years, some of the city's professional firefighters have tried to push the
    city toward a paid emergency medical service system, insinuating that the service at the
    Beach is second-rate. </p>
    <p>That's nonsense. </p>
    <p>The principal difference between professionals and volunteers is the pay. The
    volunteers are highly trained. Indeed, in survey after survey, Beach residents say they
    not only are satisfied with their all-volunteer ambulance crews, they are proud of them. </p>
    <p>They also support the service generously with contributions. What's wrong with that? </p>
    <p>Best of all, rides to the hospital are free at the Beach. In other cities, those who
    avail themselves of an ambulance can count on finding a bill in the mail later. Yet
    collection rates for ambulance bills are uniformly low in cities that charge, so the fees
    hardly constitute a big money-maker. </p>
    <p>Firefighters have pointed to the Beach's 8.6 minute response time as an indication that
    rescue services in the Resort City are sub-par. They say response times are quicker in
    other cities in Hampton Roads, cities with paid staff. </p>
    <p>But that's not a fair comparison. With more than 300 square miles in the Beach rescue
    territory -- much of it rural -- reducing the <i>average </i>response time is harder than
    in neighboring cities. It isn't certain, in any case, that professionals would
    significantly reduce the average. </p>
    <p>The all-volunteer system isn't perfect. It's not right for many cities, perhaps most.
    But it works in Virginia Beach. </p>
    <p>It would work even better if there were more cooperation between paid firefighters and
    volunteer rescue squads. Turf battles over who is in charge of emergency medical treatment
    on the scene are counterproductive. </p>
    <p>Steps toward a truce between firefighters and emergency medical personnel began this
    spring, when the fire chief and EMS director began meeting to iron out some of their
    difficulties. They're scheduled to meet again this week in hopes of reaching some final
    agreements. The ultimate goal is seamless emergency medical services, no matter who
    arrives first on the scene. </p>
    <p>Meantime, the fact that Virginia Beach retains some small-town values -- like
    volunteerism -- is a good thing. May the volunteer rescue squad continue to prosper as it
    saves lives.
