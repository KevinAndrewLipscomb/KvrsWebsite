<h3>What does membership entail?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><i><b>Regular members</b></i> must stand four twelve-hour duty shifts per month. Leave from
    scheduled duties is available on a limited basis. Ambulance and crash truck crews must
    stay at the station when they bunk down, but they may run errands and eat meals within our
    district during business hours. Maintaining one's certifications requires additional time
    in classroom and drill settings.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i><b>Associate membership</b></i> is available for ALS-certified individuals who are Virginia
    Beach firefighters or who stay active with other ALS EMS agencies. The duty requirement
    for Associate Members is two twelve-hour shifts per month.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The <i><b>College Student Apprenticeship Program</b></i> is available for
   full time students of accredited colleges or universities in Virginia who
   stay active with an EMS agency in their school locale.&nbsp; The duty
   requirement is twelve twelve-hour shifts per year (usually run during summer
   and holiday breaks).<br>
  </li>
  <li><i><b>Administrative members</b></i> must fulfill the requirements of their billet. They may
    participate in field support operations, and we encourage them to stay active in various
    committees.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How does one become a member?</h3>

<ul>
  <p>To become a member, call or visit the Virginia
  Beach Department of Emergency Medical Services during business hours (+1- 757-437-4850,
  1917 Arctic Avenue, Virginia Beach, VA 23451). There, you will view an
  orientation presentation, you will receive an application packet, and you will be given an
  opportunity to sign up for upcoming classes. Completed applications are
